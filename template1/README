Summary of animation:
The harsh life of Antarctic creatures

A penguin sees another penguin give a fish to a penguin of the opposite sex which accepts that penguin as its mate.
The penguin (who needs a mate) wants to try that out also. It goes into the water and picks up a fish. However, 
a killer whale chases after it and tries to eat it, but the penguin narrowly escapes. That penguin tries to give the fish
to another penguin, which rejects it and walks away. The penguin sadly stands there holding the fish.

For hierarchial objects, there are the penguins wings. The polygonal object is the killer whale's fin which is a weirdly shaped pyramid.
The texture mapped objects are the killer whale, the penguin, and the end screen. Both the killer whale and the penguins textures were
made by hand, with a paint tool.

I modified some of anim.cpp and some other files to be able to compile on Linux. Because of that, my project might not compile on
Windows or Mac. I hope there isn't an issue with that.
